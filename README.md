This repository demonstrates how to use [``SQcircuit``](https://github.com/stanfordLINQS/SQcircuit) to simulate superconducting circuits. On examples ranging from simple qubits to state-of-the-art circuits in the literature, we show how to easily reproduce the main results of papers with ``SQcircuit``. 

There are also a set of tutorial notebooks showing how to use ``SQcircuit`` to compute the gradient of circuit properties (eigenfrequencies, decoherence times, coupling operators, â€¦) with respect to the values of circuit elements, and how to use this information to optimize circuits for target performance.

## Simulating qubits from the literature

* [Qubit protected by two Cooper-pair tunneling](examples/two_CPB.ipynb): [Smith2020](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41534-019-0231-2) designed a qubit that is protected by two-Cooper-pair tunneling. This notebook reproduces the energy spectrum of the paper for the circuit.

* [Kite Circuit](examples/kite.ipynb): [Smith2022](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevX.12.021002) designed a superconducting circuit that magnifies quantum phase fluctuations with Cooper-pair pairing. This notebook reproduces the figures from the paper including energy spectrum, wavefunctions, and matrix elements.

* [Inductively Shunted Circuit](examples/inductively_shunted.ipynb): [Smith2016](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevB.94.144507) explained how conventional methods and perturbation theory do not correctly diagonalize their highly anharmonic inductively-shunted qubits. This notebook demonstrates how ``SQcircuit`` can quickly compute the exact energy spectrum without needing to consider these details.

* [Zero-Pi Qubit](examples/zeropi_qubit.ipynb): This notebook calculates the energy spectrum and eigenfunctions of the zero-pi qubit from [Groszkowski2018](https://doi.org/10.1088/1367-2630/aab7cd).

* [Flux Qubit](examples/flux_qubit.ipynb): This notebook calculates the energy spectrum of the flux qubit from [Robertson2006](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevB.73.174526).

## Calculating gradients and performing optimization

* [Calculating gradients](examples/calculating_gradients.ipynb): This notebook shows how to calculate gradients with ``SQcircuit``.

* [Performing optimization](examples/gradient_based_optimization.ipynb): This notebook uses SQcircuit and PyTorch to perform gradient descent optimization with a fluxonium to achieve a desired qubit frequency.
