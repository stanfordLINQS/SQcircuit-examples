To manifest the potential of the SQcircuit, we prepared the examples from simple qubits to state-of-the-art 
superconducting circuits of the literature, in which we effortlessly reproduce the main result of the paper 
by SQcircuit functionalities. One can find the jupyter notebook examples in example folder, some of which are:

* [Qubit protected by two Cooper-pair tunneling](https://github.com/stanfordLINQS/SQcircuit-examples/blob/main/examples/twoCPB.ipynb):
[Smith2020](https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1038/s41534-019-0231-2)
designed a qubit that is protected by two Cooper-pair tunneling. We reproduced the main results of the paper such as
energy spectrum, wavefunctions, and matrix elements by use of SQcircuit.
* [Inductively Shunted Circuit](https://github.com/stanfordLINQS/SQcircuit-examples/blob/main/examples/inductivelyShunted.ipynb):
[Smith2016](https://journals-aps-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.94.144507)
explained how the conventional method or perturbation theory does not correctly diagonalize their 
highly anharmonic inductively-shunted qubits. However, by using SQcircuit, we simply reproduced the energy spectrum.
* [Zero-Pi Qubit](https://github.com/stanfordLINQS/SQcircuit-examples/blob/main/examples/zeroPiQubit.ipynb): We calculated the
energy spectrum and eigenfunctions of the zero-pi qubit from [Groszkowski2018](https://iopscience-iop-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/article/10.1088/1367-2630/aab7cd)
