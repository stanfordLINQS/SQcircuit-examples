To manifest the potential of the SQcircuit, we prepared the examples from simple qubits to state-of-the-art 
superconducting circuits of the literature, in which we effortlessly reproduce the main result of the paper 
by SQcircuit functionalities. One can find the jupyter notebook examples in example folder, some of which are:

* [Qubit protected by two Cooper-pair tunneling](https://github.com/stanfordLINQS/SQcircuit-examples/blob/main/examples/two_CPB.ipynb):
[Smith2020](https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1038/s41534-019-0231-2)
designed a superconducting circuit that maginfies quantum phase fluctuations with Cooper-pair pairing. We reproduced the energy spectrum of the paper for the circuit.

* [Kite Circuit](https://github.com/stanfordLINQS/SQcircuit-examples/blob/main/examples/kite.ipynb):
[Smith2022](https://journals-aps-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/prx/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevX.12.021002)
designed a qubit that is protected by two Cooper-pair tunneling. We reproduced the main results of the paper such as
energy spectrum, wavefunctions, and matrix elements by use of SQcircuit.

* [Inductively Shunted Circuit](https://github.com/stanfordLINQS/SQcircuit-examples/blob/main/examples/inductively_shunted.ipynb):
[Smith2016](https://journals-aps-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.94.144507)
explained how the conventional method or perturbation theory does not correctly diagonalize their 
highly anharmonic inductively-shunted qubits. However, by using SQcircuit, we simply reproduced the energy spectrum.

* [Zero-Pi Qubit](https://github.com/stanfordLINQS/SQcircuit-examples/blob/main/examples/zeropi_qubit.ipynb): We calculated the
energy spectrum and eigenfunctions of the zero-pi qubit from [Groszkowski2018](https://iopscience-iop-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/article/10.1088/1367-2630/aab7cd)

* [Flux Qubit](https://github.com/stanfordLINQS/SQcircuit-examples/blob/main/examples/flux_qubit.ipynb): We calculated the
energy spectrum of the flux qubit from [Robertson2006](https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.73.174526)
